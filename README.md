# CRUD Operations

Here we are making a product manaement system using JS where user can add, delete, update and see the products.
also user can filter the products by productID, productName and productPrice.

Here i added a GenerateDummyData() fuction which creates dummy data for testing.
you can use that in console. 
(Note : maximum 800 dummy data can generate after that storage limit are exceed)
